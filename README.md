`sentimental` : Tools to Work with the [`text-processing.com`](text-processing.com) API.

If you have modest NLP needs, this API package provides an alternative to getting Java-based packages to work or performing processing on your local system.

NOTE: There is a limit of 1,000 API calls per day imposed by the API.

The following functions are implemented:

-   `part_of_speech`: Part-of-peech tagging and chunking on text phrase\_extract\`: Phrase extraction & named entity recognition on text
-   `sentiment`: Analyze the sentiment of text
-   `sentimental`: Tools to Work with the '[text-processing.com](http://text-processing.com/)' API
-   `stem`: Perform word stemming on text

### TODO

-   CRAN
-   S-expression parser (convert string to a `list`)
